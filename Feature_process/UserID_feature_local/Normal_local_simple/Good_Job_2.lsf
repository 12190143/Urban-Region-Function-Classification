# This is a sample script to test submission to LSF and the job environment
# Choose a queue that you have access (eg the normal queue) and submit
# job as follows:
# ---
# cd ~/lsf
# bsub -q normal < Good_Job_0.lsf
# bjobs a
# ## # # B S U B -R "rusage[mem=16384]" Good_Job
# ---
# Then look in the ~/lsf/output folder for the script log
# that matches the job ID number

# module load anaconda/3-5.0.1
# Please make a copy of this script for your own modifications
